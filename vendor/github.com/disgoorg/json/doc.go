// Package json provides a configurable JSON implementation and nullable helpers. It is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the standard library's encoding/json package.
// You may want to use this package if:
// 1. You have to deal with nullable and optional fields in JSON.
// 2. You want to merge 2 JSON objects together.
// 3. You want to use a different JSON implementation, but don't want to change your code.
